# My fourth project and solution for Frontend Mentor's 3-column challenge using nth child pseudo-selectors and CSS variables

I had 2 goals during this project.

1. Get acquainted with CSS variables
2. Only use nth-child pseudo-selectors instead of classes

Both goals were accomplished.

Just keep in mind that I was not concerned whether it is good practice or not to use this approach in this project. I just needed to apply my theoretical knowledge somewhere.
